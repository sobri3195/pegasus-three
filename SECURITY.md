# Security and Privacy Guidelines

## Security Best Practices

### API Keys and Credentials

**Never commit API keys or credentials to version control**

```bash
# Use config_local.json for sensitive data
cp config.json config_local.json
# Add to .gitignore
echo "config_local.json" >> .gitignore
```

### Data Protection

1. **Encrypt Sensitive Data**
   - Use encryption for stored data
   - Secure API keys in environment variables
   - Implement secure key management

2. **Access Control**
   - Limit access to collected intelligence
   - Use role-based access control
   - Log all access attempts

3. **Secure Storage**
   - Store reports in encrypted directories
   - Use secure deletion for temporary files
   - Implement data retention policies

### Network Security

1. **Use HTTPS**
   - Always use HTTPS for API calls
   - Verify SSL certificates
   - Implement certificate pinning

2. **Proxy Support**
   - Route traffic through secure proxies
   - Use VPN for sensitive operations
   - Implement IP rotation if needed

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - Respect API rate limits
   - Implement exponential backoff
   - Avoid aggressive scanning

### Operational Security

1. **Authorization Documentation**
   - Maintain authorization records
   - Document scope of investigation
   - Keep audit logs

2. **Data Minimization**
   - Collect only necessary data
   - Implement data retention limits
   - Regular data purging

3. **Secure Communication**
   - Encrypt report transmission
   - Use secure channels for sharing
   - Implement access controls

## Privacy Considerations

### Legal Compliance

1. **GDPR Compliance** (EU)
   - Lawful basis for processing
   - Data subject rights
   - Privacy by design

2. **CCPA Compliance** (California)
   - Consumer rights
   - Opt-out mechanisms
   - Data disclosure

3. **Other Jurisdictions**
   - Research local laws
   - Consult legal counsel
   - Document compliance

### Ethical Guidelines

1. **Necessity Test**
   - Is the investigation necessary?
   - Is OSINT the appropriate method?
   - Are there less intrusive alternatives?

2. **Proportionality**
   - Match investigation depth to threat level
   - Avoid excessive data collection
   - Limit scope appropriately

3. **Transparency**
   - Be transparent about methods
   - Disclose when required
   - Maintain integrity

## Incident Response

### Data Breach

If collected data is compromised:

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Isolate affected systems
   - Secure remaining data
   - Document the incident

2. **Notification**
   - Notify affected individuals
   - Report to authorities if required
   - Inform stakeholders

3. **Remediation**
   - Investigate root cause
   - Implement fixes
   - Update security measures

### Unauthorized Access

If tool is misused:

1. **Detection**
   - Monitor for unusual activity
   - Review access logs
   - Check for policy violations

2. **Response**
   - Revoke access immediately
   - Investigate extent of misuse
   - Document incident

3. **Prevention**
   - Update access controls
   - Enhance monitoring
   - Provide training

## Security Checklist

Before starting investigation:

- [ ] Authorization obtained and documented
- [ ] Legal compliance verified
- [ ] API keys secured
- [ ] Secure environment configured
- [ ] Data protection measures in place
- [ ] Incident response plan ready

During investigation:

- [ ] Follow authorization scope
- [ ] Respect rate limits
- [ ] Secure data collection
- [ ] Maintain audit logs
- [ ] Monitor for anomalies

After investigation:

- [ ] Secure report storage
- [ ] Implement access controls
- [ ] Schedule data review
- [ ] Plan data retention
- [ ] Document lessons learned

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **Do NOT** open a public issue
2. Email security concerns privately
3. Provide detailed description
4. Allow time for fix before disclosure
5. Follow responsible disclosure

## Updates and Patches

- Keep dependencies updated
- Monitor security advisories
- Apply patches promptly
- Test after updates
- Document changes
